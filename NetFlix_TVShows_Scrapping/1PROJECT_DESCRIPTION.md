# **📌 Web Scraping IMDb for Netflix TV Show Episode Counts**  
### *(A Subpart of the "Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analysis" Project)*  

## **🚀 Project Overview**  
In the **Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analysis** project, a key challenge was that **TV show duration was provided only in terms of seasons**, making it difficult to compare with movies. To overcome this, I built a **web scraping script** that extracts the **number of episodes per TV show from IMDb**, allowing for a more accurate analysis of content duration. 

Using **BeautifulSoup and Selenium**, this automates the retrieval of episode counts, enabling **better insights into Netflix’s TV show lengths** and enhancing the overall dataset for deeper analysis.
